					<h3 class="sectionTop">Sunken</h3>
						<p class="main-text">
							In 2012, the band recorded their debut album, Sunken, in James' basement using "a crappy iMac from 2004, a broken digital mixer, and a digital recording studio from the '90s". he 20-minute album, named after a park in Chicago where the band members used to drink as teenagers, was released on July 9, 2013.

					<h3 class="sectionTop">Wild Onion</h3>
						<p class="main-text">
							The band began work on their follow-up record, Wild Onion, in January 2014 in Chicago. The album was released by Grand Jury on August 5, 2014 in North America, and in the UK on September 1, 2014 by Communion Music. Rolling Stone gave the album a 3.5 out of 5 saying that they “pull off Exile-era Stones strut and Velvet Underground guitar poesy with a sophistication that’s beyond their years, and a sense of humor, too.”
						</p>
						<p class="main-text">
						The band had a breakout performance at Pitchfork Music Festival in July 2014, just before Wild Onion was released. Prior to the festival, James broke his foot at an Orwells concert in New Orleans and had to play from a wheelchair.[8] The performance received a lot of press and some called it the best set of the weekend.[9] The following summer, Twin Peaks played Lollapalooza for the first time.
