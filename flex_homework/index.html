                <p>Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Our solar system
                    consists
                    of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth,
                    Mars,
                    Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of
                    asteroids, comets and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of
                    planetary
                    systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</p>

                    <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger
                        than Earth's Moon.</p>

                <div><p>Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot. The brightest and
                    largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home
                    planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating
                    a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a
                    Mars-sized body collided with Earth. Our moon is the fifth largest of the 190+ moons orbiting
                    planets in our solar system.</p></div>
